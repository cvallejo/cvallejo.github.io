  <h2 class="text-2xl text-orange-400 font-semibold mb-4">🥂 About Me</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">Originally trained as an agronomist, I’ve evolved into an architect of technological platforms for industries still clinging to Excel as if it were a sacred scripture. I’ve founded companies across three continents, built infrastructure for global trade analysis, and led projects at the intersection of design, data, and obsessive attention to detail.</p>
  <p>I operate somewhere between clean code, export maps, interactive dashboards, and coffee that’s never strong enough.</p>

  <p class="mb-2 font-semibold">Founder & CEO – Intelvid / Winesfere / Vitispro / Eziviu</p>
  <p class="mb-4 text-sm text-gray-400">Global | Since the BlackBerry was still cool</p>

  <h2 class="text-2xl text-orange-400 font-semibold mb-4">🧠 Core Skills</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
    <li><strong>Laravel + Livewire + Alpine.js:</strong> What others build in three days, I refactor in one afternoon.</li>
    <li><strong>PostgreSQL:</strong> Not a database, a second language.</li>
    <li><strong>Python & FastAPI:</strong> Clean, fast, and aesthetically correct backends.</li>
    <li><strong>Cloud Ops:</strong> AWS, GCP, Azure — and sometimes, better than their own docs.</li>
    <li><strong>Data Visualization:</strong> Not just pretty charts. Purposeful insights.</li>
    <li><strong>UX Design:</strong> No fluff. Just clarity, elegance, and strategic simplicity.</li>
  </ul>

<section class="mb-16">
  <h2 class="text-2xl text-orange-400 font-semibold mb-4">📉 Soft Skills (Actually Useful)</h2>
  <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
    <li>Zero tolerance for mediocrity.</li>
    <li>Sharp critic of poorly argued ideas.</li>
    <li>Perfectionist with deadlines (a rare breed).</li>
    <li>Automatic BS detector.</li>
    <li>Sniper-level focus until someone says “let’s brainstorm.”</li>

</section>

<section class="mb-16">
  <h2 class="text-2xl text-orange-400 font-semibold mb-4">🧭 Work Philosophy</h2>
  <p class="mb-4">I don’t do MVPs to “see if it sticks.” I design strong products from day one — because time is finite and mediocrity is expensive.</p>
  <p>I bring together data, structure, business vision, and aesthetic obsession to build systems that work... and look like they mean it.</p>
