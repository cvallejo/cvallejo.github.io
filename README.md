# Claudio Vallejo – GitHub Page

This is the source code for my GitHub landing page, built entirely with Tailwind CSS and served via GitHub Pages.  
No frameworks, no JS bloat, no build steps — just HTML, sarcasm, and clarity.

## 🌍 What is this?

A minimal but elegant personal profile page — part tech résumé, part manifesto — that summarizes what I do:

- Architect data infrastructure across industries and continents
- Build platforms that actually work (not just pitch decks)
- Combine aesthetics, performance, and purpose
- Occasionally write backends that outshine entire PDF reports

## 🎨 Tech stack

- Tailwind CSS (via CDN)
- HTML5 (handcrafted, no copy/paste from templates)
- GitHub Pages (because I like frictionless deployments)

## 📫 Want to contact me?

You could send an email… but if your idea’s not ready, I won’t reply.

👉 [https://claudio-vallejo.com](https://claudio-vallejo.com)  
That’s where all the grown-up contact happens.

## 🧪 Warning

This repo contains:
- No React
- No Web3
- No hype

Just a clear message, a clean design, and a bit of personality.
